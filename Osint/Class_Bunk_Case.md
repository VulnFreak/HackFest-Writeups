When you this url you will get a google document and it have text in it

```
I am your physics teacher and I want to say you missed a lot of work as you are not attending the classes for the last few weeks and I want to talk to your parents. And we will send the official letter to your parents regarding this issue so that they get to know about your irregularities in studies. 

And remember Past is very important. I mean PAST lecture The lectures you missed are having all things for you but I don’t think you will check the PAST I mean PAST Lecture. 

Don’t bunk from now otherwise, you will be suspended from the school.

```

so in this you can see past is high lighted and this is the hint here. We have to use [waybackmachine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctf.noobarmy.tech) To check the past of the notes file.


There you find a code `74unggw`.

Since online classes are the main point of the challenge.

we have to find online class platform that need code to enter class so there are lot but in our this is `google classroom` just put the code in it you will get the flag there.
