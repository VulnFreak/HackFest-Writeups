I want to buy the book from online store recommended by my friend but I am not able to find the book online so I asked him to send the book detail so he sended me the ISBN number of the book but while printing the details some digits in between get ddestroyed can you help me to get back the complete number.

ISBN received - 9788*****5025

Hint : Number is divisble by 1235


So from Desc it is clear that it is isbn number and if we count the total digits it is 13 in length so this is 13 digit isbn number we have just bruteforce the number.

you can check the algorithm from [here :](https://isbn-information.com/check-digit-for-the-13-digit-isbn.html) and just remeber it is divisble by 1235. For script check file
