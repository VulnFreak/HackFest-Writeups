This challenge description states that

`Everyone says area 52 is suspicous but I disagree I think area 417 is more suspicious now you have to help me to prove that area 417 is more suspicious then 52.`

If you focus in this two number are repeated again and again that is 52 and 417 and challenge name also have 417 in name.
We also have image file with it if you see the image file then you find that it have something odd like complete image is blur not clear but the barcode on it are clear so if attach that hint with the  desc hint ( barcode 417 ). Then you will get to know that it is pdf 417.
You have to just crop that barcode and decode it.
