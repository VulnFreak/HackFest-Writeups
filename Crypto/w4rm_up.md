# W4rm_up

When you open the [Challenge File](https://github.com/VulnFreak/HACKFEST_0x01/blob/main/Crypto/w4rm_up/chall.txt) it has a very big string of Base64 Encoding. Basically It was base64 Encoding Multiple times like more than 20 or 30 times xD

You can use this [script](https://github.com/VulnFreak/HackFest-Writeups/blob/main/scripts/w4rm_up.py) to decode it

After Decoding it by script you can get flag 

Flag `hf0x01{th4t_much_w4rmup_i$_3n0ugh_i_think_xD}`
