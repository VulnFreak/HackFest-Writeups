Binwalk to Extract it
Hit this command in terminal `$ binwalk --dd=".*" robot.jpg`


After Extracting the zip from image when you try to open it. It will asks for Password. <br>
In Description you saw **Darlene : f0xscy help you when you needed**  The **f0xscy** was the password for that zip file <br>
After extracting the Zip file you get Two Directories one with **H4ck** Name which contains only fake flags xD it was just a rabbit hole <br>
And the another directory which name 1337 which is **hidden** directory and inside the 1337 Directory there is three more directory **flag01 flag02 flag 03** <br>
And in each directory there is one text file one robot image and one Corrupted robot1.jpg <br>
When you correct the Corrupted image Robot1.jpg  of Flag02 Directory you will get the flag with image but the flag was in reverse format <br>
